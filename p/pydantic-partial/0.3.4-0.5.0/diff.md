 `pydantic-partial` will not be able to detect which fields may allow to being
 converted to partial models.
 
 **Also note:** My recommendation would be to always create such recursive
 partials by creating partials for all the required models and then override
 the fields on you outer partial model class. This is way more explicit.
 
+## Known limitations
+
+`pydantic-partial` cannot generate new class types that actually are supported by the
+Python typing system rules. This means that the partial models will only be recognized
+as the same as their original model classes - type checkers will not know about the partial
+model changes and thus will think all those partial fields are still required.
+
+This is due to the fact that Python itself has no concept of partials. `pydantic-partial`
+could (in theory) provide plugins for `mypy` for example to "patch" this in, but this would
+be a massive amount of work while being kind of a bad hack. The real solution would be to
+have a partial type in Python itself, but this is not planned for the near future as far
+as I know.
+
+My recommendation is to use `pydantic-partial` only for API use cases where you do not
+need to work with the partial aspects of the models - they are just the DTOs (data transfer
+objects) you are using. If you need to use partial models in other cases you might get
+errors by your type checker - if you use one. Please be aware of this.
+
+**Note:** Not having a good solution in Python itself for this is the reason `pydantic` does
+not support partial models in the first place. `pydantic-partial` is just a really good
+workaround for this issue.  
+See [issue 2](https://github.com/team23/pydantic-partial/issues/2) in this project and
+[issue 1673](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1673#issuecomment-1557267229)
+in the `pydantic` project for reference.
+
+Having that all said: If anyone wants to get a working plugin for `mypy` or others ready,
+I'm going to very much support this.

 ### Recursive partials
 
 Partial models can be created changing the field of all nested models to being
 optional, too.

 `pydantic-partial` will not be able to detect which fields may allow to being
 converted to partial models.
 
 **Also note:** My recommendation would be to always create such recursive
 partials by creating partials for all the required models and then override
 the fields on you outer partial model class. This is way more explicit.
 
+## Known limitations
+
+`pydantic-partial` cannot generate new class types that actually are supported by the
+Python typing system rules. This means that the partial models will only be recognized
+as the same as their original model classes - type checkers will not know about the partial
+model changes and thus will think all those partial fields are still required.
+
+This is due to the fact that Python itself has no concept of partials. `pydantic-partial`
+could (in theory) provide plugins for `mypy` for example to "patch" this in, but this would
+be a massive amount of work while being kind of a bad hack. The real solution would be to
+have a partial type in Python itself, but this is not planned for the near future as far
+as I know.
+
+My recommendation is to use `pydantic-partial` only for API use cases where you do not
+need to work with the partial aspects of the models - they are just the DTOs (data transfer
+objects) you are using. If you need to use partial models in other cases you might get
+errors by your type checker - if you use one. Please be aware of this.
+
+**Note:** Not having a good solution in Python itself for this is the reason `pydantic` does
+not support partial models in the first place. `pydantic-partial` is just a really good
+workaround for this issue.  
+See [issue 2](https://github.com/team23/pydantic-partial/issues/2) in this project and
+[issue 1673](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1673#issuecomment-1557267229)
+in the `pydantic` project for reference.
+
+Having that all said: If anyone wants to get a working plugin for `mypy` or others ready,
+I'm going to very much support this.
